# Book-Recommendation
A Streamlit web app that recommends books using three approaches:  Collaborative Filtering (SVD) – learns from user–item interactions.  Popularity Baseline – ranks books by average rating &amp; number of ratings.  Hybrid (CF + Content) – blends collaborative filtering with book metadata (title, author, publisher).
